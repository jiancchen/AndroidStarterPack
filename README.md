# Android Starter Project
## Project Overview

This starter project is an Android application designed with modern architecture and libraries. It includes fundamental dependencies such as Hilt for dependency injection, Room for local database management, Retrofit combined with OkHttp for network operations. This setup provides a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable Android applications. I'll keep this continually updated as libraries update.

## Key Features

Hilt for dependency injection, simplifying the way you manage dependencies in your application.
Room as an abstraction layer over SQLite, allowing for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
Retrofit with OkHttp for efficient network requests and easy REST API consumption.
