# Android Starter Project
## Project Overview

This starter project is an Android application designed with modern architecture and libraries. It includes fundamental dependencies such as Hilt for dependency injection, Room for local database management, Retrofit combined with OkHttp for network operations. This setup provides a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable Android applications. I'll keep this continually updated as libraries update.

## Key Features

Hilt for dependency injection, simplifying the way you manage dependencies in your application.
Room as an abstraction layer over SQLite, allowing for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
Retrofit with OkHttp for efficient network requests and easy REST API consumption.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and import it into Android Studio.

## Important
Rename the package name and project before working. To do this, right click on the project in the project explorer in (Android Mode),
select the gear icon and make the that compact empty middle box is selected. Then right click on the project in the project explorer in (Android Mode), select refactor, and rename the project. 
This will rename the package name and project name throughout the project.

Remember to remove the .git folder from the project before pushing to a new repository.

## Architecture

This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and easier testing.
